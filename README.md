Walmart Black Friday Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis:

In this project, I analyzed Walmart's customer purchase behavior during Black Friday, focusing on purchase amounts in relation to gender and other factors. The analysis revealed that men made about three times more purchases than women, with a significant difference in average spending between gendersâ€”men's average spending was approximately 8735. The study also found that city category B saw the highest spending and that nearly 60% of customers were married, though marital status did not significantly impact spending habits. I identified no missing data, but outliers accounted for 1.24% of total spending, representing unusually high purchase amounts.

Key insights include:

Men spend more across all city categories, with the highest spending in city category B.
Spending habits between married and unmarried customers were similar, suggesting a unified marketing approach.
Job type did not lead to significant differences in spending, and both genders purchased a similar variety of products.
Based on these findings, I recommended:

Targeting Men in Ads: Focus advertising campaigns on attracting more male shoppers, particularly in city categories B and C where spending is highest.
Unified Marketing Strategy: Use the same marketing approach for both married and unmarried customers due to the lack of significant spending differences.
Special Promotions for Big Spenders: Offer loyalty programs or special deals to customers who are high spenders to encourage repeat purchases.
Adjusting Product Offers by Gender: Tailor product offerings based on gender preferences to enhance appeal and drive sales.
Age-specific Marketing: Develop campaigns that cater to different age groups based on their spending habits.
Enhancing Online and In-store Experience: Improve both online and in-store shopping experiences to equally serve new and long-term residents, as the length of stay in a city did not significantly affect spending.
